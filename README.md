## profile
Hi everyone, my name is Myranda and I'm a 2nd year MURP, with a concentration in Design and Development. I was born and raised in Salinas/Prunedale, where I spent some of my childhood summers on my grandma's catering truck. I transferred to UCLA and was part of the first cohort of undergrad students to earn a BA in Public Affairs from Luskin 🐻. I did not have a planning background before starting the program, but my interests are access to open space/green space, environmental justice, and climate equity/resilience. I am currently working in LA City Planning's enviornmetal justice unit and look forward to applying what I learn in this class to my future work.

## description of the course
This course will help students address urban problems by using Python to spatially represent data.
## project ideas
One of the project ideas I have in mind is mapping 📍 lived experiences of climate change experiences in vulnerable communities based on survey data.
## objectives for class
I have zero experience with Python and GIS, so I hope I can learn a new skill set that will help me create effective maps🗺️.
